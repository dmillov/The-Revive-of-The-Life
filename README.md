# The Revive of The Life
Game Lore: "The Revive of The Life"

Setting:

After a global catastrophe, the world was on the brink of extinction. A few decades ago, a mysterious ecological catastrophe wiped out almost all vegetation and most of the living creatures on Earth.
The atmosphere was filled with toxic clouds, the water became poisonous, and the soil became uninhabitable. Humans survived in isolated settlements, using remnants of past technology to sustain life.Cities turned into ruined metropolises, where vegetation completely disappeared and the former forests and fields became barren deserts.

Сatastrophe:

The source of the catastrophe was a phenomenon called “The Fall”. The reasons for its origin remain unclear:
some blame it on large corporations, some on government experiments with climate control, and others on natural anomalies. After "The Fall", the planet's surface became uninhabitable.

The players mission:

The player takes the role of one of the “Pilgrims”, tasked with accelerating the process of nature's regeneration. Using ancient technologies, bioengineering, and his ability to interact with new life forms, he must travel the world, seek out key points of nature's regeneration, and protect them from threats. These threats include remnants of old government factions who want to use the reviving nature to their advantage, and dangerous mutated organisms created by the catastrophe.
